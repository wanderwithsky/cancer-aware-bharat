"""Dev-only seed data. Run with: python -m app.seed

Ports the hardcoded arrays from the frontend's src/data.ts so the API has
something to serve while the dashboards are wired up. Safe to re-run --
skips anything that already exists.

Every account this script creates uses the same publicly-documented password
("ChangeMe123!", see README). It refuses to run against a production
environment for that reason -- use `python -m app.create_superadmin` there
instead, which prompts for a real password interactively.
